# RandomWalker
This is a project to make a random world with a random walker

The documentation needs to be updated and that will happen soon, the same for comments in the code ;)

You can get the best results by setting the world size by 300 by 300, and the more walkers the more diversity you get.
The logic where to place objects (biomes) is hard coded in the WorldLogic script.

On the gameobject WorldManager can you set values for the world, some things are hard coded in the script attached to this gameobject.

If you have any questions just let me know :)
